# machine-learning-codes
These are some basic low level machine learning codes that i have been practicing and polishing my skills on.

My main focus on machine learning to enhance the model to a great extent.
For the first program - Its pretty basic and self explanatory, a python code that analyzes data from an excel sheet. It divides the data into training and testing data in the ratio of 80-20% respectively.
Again it is pretty basic , will work and post more regarding machine learning.
