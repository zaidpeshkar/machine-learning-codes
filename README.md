# machine-learning-codes
These are some basic low level machine learning codes that i have been practicing and polishing my skills on.

My main focus on machine learning to enhance the model to a great extent.

#1
For the first program - Its pretty basic and self explanatory, a python code that analyzes data from an excel sheet. It divides the data into training and testing data in the ratio of 80-20% respectively. And remodels the data into a decision tree.
Again it is pretty basic , will work and post more regarding machine learning.

#2
The second file is related to Hear Disease Prediction which is inspired from kaggle.com. This machine learning code uses logistic regression. *WHAT IS LOGISTIC REGRESSION?*- classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields. It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more sets of independent variables to predict outcomes. It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.

The main aim of this model is to find out the patients who are more likely to possess a chance of being affected by Cardiovascular Disease(CVD).
